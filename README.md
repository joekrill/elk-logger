This is a simple Node app that logs messages from an Elk M1 panel to a SQLite or Postgres database. I mainly threw this together to test my [`elk-client`](https://github.com/joekrill/elk-client) and [`elk-message`](https://github.com/joekrill/elk-message), as well as to collect some historical data that I could potentially use at a later time.
